# 🧵 Chapter 1 —  Process and threads  

This chapter introduces the basic concepts of parallelism using Python threads.  
It compares normal (single-threaded) execution with multi-threaded execution to show performance differences.

Files included:

- CHAPTER 1/normal_sum.py → Demonstrates sequential execution using a single thread  
- CHAPTER 1/threaded_sum.py → Demonstrates parallel execution using multiple threads  
- CHAPTER 1/screenshots/ → Contains screenshots showing output and performance comparison
