PDC  -  Parallel and Distributed Computing

This repository contains examples demonstrating both process-based and thread-based execution in Python.

Folder Structure

CHAPTER 1

- CHAPTER 1/normal_sum.py â†’ Normal (single-thread) sum example  
- CHAPTER 1/threaded_sum.py â†’ Thread-based sum example  
- CHAPTER 1/screenshots/ â†’ Screenshots of Chapter 1 code execution  

CHAPTER 2
This chapter includes examples showing thread synchronization using different techniques:

- CHAPTER 2/condition_sum.py â†’ Uses Condition for thread coordination  
- CHAPTER 2/lock_sum.py â†’ Uses Lock to prevent race conditions  
- CHAPTER 2/rlock_sum.py â†’ Uses RLock (re-entrant lock) for nested locking situations  
- CHAPTER 2/semaphore_sum.py â†’ Uses Semaphore to limit concurrent access  
- CHAPTER 2/screenshots/ â†’ Screenshots of Chapter 2 code execution  

Description

Both chapters calculate the sum of a large array (1 to 1,000,000).  

- Chapter 1 demonstrates the basic comparison between normal (single-threaded) and threaded execution.  
- Chapter 2 introduces synchronization concepts in multi-threading, ensuring safe and coordinated thread operations.
